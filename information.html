		<h2>Questions, Answers and other Information</h2>

		<h3>Why haven't servers disabled this disconnect?</h3>
		<p>Some of them have! Although a lot haven't because the issue seems to have gotten less common, and realistically the better solution is to have people ensure their system time is synced. Generally the easiest option for servers utilizing the Bukkit of Forks is to have a plugin with an event listener which checks the disconnect reason and cancels out-of-order chat disconnects.</p>

		<h3>Why does this page exist?</h3>
		<p>I've had to explain and help people with this issue a few times, and I have gotten fed up with doing so, so I created this page to do that for me, somewhat inspired by sites like <a target="_blank" href="https://nohello.net">nohello.net</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://dontasktoask.com">dontasktoask.com</a>. Anyone is free to link to this resource when needed.</p>

		<h3>Why doesn't Mojang have a support page for this?</h3>
		<p>If such a support page exists, then I haven't found it, which kinda serves to prove the general point that Mojang has done a bad job at communicating the changes made with 1.19. Considering Mojang's actions over the years its not really a supprise, especially given the fact that the game's playability is partly the result of community efforts (see OptiFine, Sodium, Paper, etc.), although I am fairly opinionated to take that with a grain of salt.</p>

		<h3>Why does Minecraft care about the time?</h3>
		<i>I am not an expert in cryptography, this may be incorrect, do your own research if you care, contact and correct me if you know better.</i>
		<p>Chat messages are signed with a key to verify the sender, this key is only valid for 48 hours. As a result, the time at which a message was signed, sent, and received by the server is important, so the server checks to see that the time a message was sent makes sense. The argument could be made that currently the server is too strict with enforcing the time, however making it more relaxed means making it less secure. Minecraft is not the only application that cares about the time, if you desync your time enough, Chrome (and probably other browsers) will refuse to load pages as it can't verify that the sites SSL certificate is or is not expired.</p>
